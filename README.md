# Youth-group-attendance
Accepts Churchbuilder attendance spreadsheets and creates a new spreadsheet with the attendance totals over the given period.

Usage:

Initiate the program and enter as many registers that you'd like to appear together in the final spreadsheet.
Note - group names will appear as column headers in the final spreadsheet
Type q to quit once you've entered all the .ods files
The new file - 'Total Attendance.xlsx' will appear in the working directory

Test the program with 'attendance example.ods'
